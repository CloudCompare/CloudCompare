# CMakeLists.txt for qPDF3DIO ui directory
# =========================================
#
# This file would list UI files if the plugin had Qt Designer forms.
# Currently, the plugin doesn't have custom UI dialogs, but this file
# is kept for future use and consistency with other plugins.
#
# Future: If export options dialog is added, UI files would be listed here
# and processed with qt6_wrap_ui()
