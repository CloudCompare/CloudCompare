From Thomas S. (http://www.cloudcompare.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=550)
[*] If CloudCompare would support VisualSFM, it would be possible to import the VisualSFM-Project (with the saved camera positions).
	Then it should be possible to measure the points for the georeferencing in the images itself, instead of the point-cloud, which would be much more accurate.

From Andrew B.
[*] 'minimise bounding box' or various automated ways to make objects 'stand up' the way they are supposed to or be rigid-transformed on the basis of perceived axial symmetry
[*] An automatic 'scale to unit size' in cases where compare different sized things is of interest, but size can be discarded or treated separately
[*] Automation of the above tasks via the command line

From AdrienA
[*] Radiance scaling shader

From Chartzell
[*] A limit box- Being able to hide portions of the clouds you are working on can make the registration process much quicker and easier. With a customizable limit box you can look at just a small cross section of the clouds to get a good view of how well they fit together and what adjustments need to be made. Ideally, you would be able to push and pull on the various sides of the box to change it's dimensions.

From Konrad W.
[*] Something like the plane shader from point tools where the depth is coloured with the Hue channel
[*] Out-of-core support (like those guys: http://ros.org/wiki/megatree or the out-of-core structure in the PCL)

From Rav M.
[*] Add front and back cutting plane
[*] move and rotate global coordinate (X,Y,Z) or aligning it like camera and then adding another parts to correct scene in right place.

From Gianluca C.
[*] to overlay an image over the mesh with some common points and "drape" the photo on the surface

From Eugene L.
[*] To be able to transfer color from a jpg image to a mesh or point cloud. (same as Gianluca?)
[*] Would it be possible to enter a % value like 95% and then obtain the exact value for the number of points that fall in that range?

From Andrew O.
[*] add some type of 3D eraser. Perhaps being able to select and clear an octree cell may be the place to start (http://www.cloudcompare.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=191)

From Tim C.
[*] Translate/Rotate with keys or GUI buttons (http://www.cloudcompare.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=556)

From Andrew O.
[*] Small Clouds: I consider a cloud to be 2 or more data points. Small clouds don't behave well in Cloud compare. RANSAC, Connected Components and some other functions either crash the app or hang or go off in an endless loop when this is the case. 
[*] Selected Sets: It would be nice to be able to work with a selected set rather than having to segment the cloud. What you need here is some database functionality. Since CloudCompare is an analysis tool, it could benefit from conceptual thinking from the GIS world. Filtering scalar fields is a good start - I use that a lot. Being able to do some simple SQL to grab points into a set would be very helpful. This ties in with my comment on attributes below. 
[*] Point ID: It would be nice if Ascii import could import the "labels: for points. I don't expect to be able to render labels for a large cloud - that would be silly. They can be accessed in point collection, but I'd like to be able to use my own labels as they occur rather than think my way through a zero based collection based on point order. They need to be alpha-numeric. This relates to the selected sets comment above. 
[*] 3-d Line: There is a lot of functionality for planes, spheres etc, but there is no line primitive.There are case where I would like to be able to model a line of best fit on observed points and compare that to another edge. For example, I have a current task to compare columns in a structure and we are measuring multiple points on the edge of steel members. It would be good to implement a number of objects: segment (two point), string (>2 points) etc. The mirror to this in the primitive space would be objects such as lemniscates, cubic spirals, helixes etc.
[*] Attributes and strings: It would be nice to be able to connect common points in a cloud according to alpha and/or numeric values in the cloud. This is common in surveying software where we code a point by an alpha/numeric code to indicate a feature type such as "edge of footpath". We would code the data with the edge as alpha and give it a string number. Then when the software encounters the data it builds lines according to the order they are in the file and the string number. Additional codes can be used to start and end strings or do more complex things. 
[*] Data Entry: It would be nice to be able to key the data for a point or points, to simply add few point to the cloud. A case where this would be advantageous is to enable to user to add in additional control data rather than having to suck in another ascii file. Alternatively in a small cloud, you may wish to edit the coordinates of a point
[*] Alignments: Nice functionality but...it would be nice if a report was produced that explained the scale, rotation and translation, mentioned the residuals, and did some statistical tests to help the user determine if it was a valid transformation.
[*] Transformations: It would be nice to be able to apply conformal and affine transformations. The current matrix system requires complex calculation outside the software to compute the 4x4 matrix from known parameters. It would be nice to apply scale,omega,kappa,phi,tx,ty,tz directly.

From 'dsims1980'
[*] Spherical Parameterization of cloud or meshes is very useful for visual comparison of two models (http://www.cloudcompare.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=581)
