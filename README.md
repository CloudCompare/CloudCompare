Introduction
------------

CloudCompare is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software.
It was originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds
(such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud and a
triangular mesh. It relies on an octree structure that is highly optimized for
this particular use-case. It was also meant to deal with huge point
clouds (typically more than 10 million points, and up to 120 million with 2 GB
of memory).
