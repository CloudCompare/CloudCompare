 * \anchor faq-non-QIODevice Q. Is there any way to use QuaZipFile in Qt
 * where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not
 * through QIODevice API?
 *
 * A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some
 * database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down
 * to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything
 * about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass QuaZipFile as
 * normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you
 * pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is
 * a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts a QIODevice
 * pointer. Then you would be able to pass QuaZipFile as well as many
 * other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess.
 *
 * \anchor faq-zip64 Q. Can QuaZIP handle files larger than 4GB? What
 * about zip64 standard?
 *
 * A. Starting with version 0.6, QuaZIP uses Minizip 1.1 with zip64
 * support which should handle large files perfectly. The zip64 support
 * in Minizip looks like it's not 100% conforming to the standard, but
 * 3rd party tools seem to have no problem with the resulting archives.
 *
 * \anchor faq-seekable Q. Can QuaZIP write archives to a sequential QIODevice like QTcpSocket?
 *
 * A. Not yet. It is not supported by vanilla Minizip (the back-end
 * QuaZIP uses), although theoretically possible according to the ZIP
 * standard. It would require some Minizip modifications that would
 * allow it to detect non-seekable I/O and produce necessary output
 * structures. QuaZIP already writes data descriptor which is necessary
 * for non-seekable I/O. The only thing that is apparently left is to
 * make Minizip fill local headers with correct values and forget about
 * seeking after closing the file.
