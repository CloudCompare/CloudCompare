 * passing this structure to
 * QuaZipFile::open(OpenMode,const QuaZipNewInfo&,int,int,bool).

 * Zip64 support of this structure is slightly limited: in the raw mode (when
 * a pre-compressed file is written into a ZIP file as-is), it is necessary
 * to specify the uncompressed file size and the appropriate field is 32 bit.
 * Since the raw mode is used extremely rare, there is no real need to have
 * a separate QuaZipNewInfo64 structure like QuaZipFileInfo64. It may be added
 * in the future though, if there is a demand for the raw mode with zip64
 * archives.
