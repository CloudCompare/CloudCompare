	* Closing the 'About' dialog would make CC crash!

v2.4 03/10/2013
- Points size can now be independently set for each cloud
	* see the 'Point size' combo-box in the cloud's properties
- The 'Align with point pairs' tool can now be used with only one cloud selected	
	(in which case reference points must be manually added with the 'pencil' icon)
- Point picking mechanism enhanced:
	- point marker is now a (selectable) 3D sphere
	- point marker default size is customizable via display options dialog
	- mesh triangles can now be picked (early version: creates a 3-points label)
	- "Point list picking" tool
		* automatically pastes last picked point in clipboard
		* string format: " CC_POINT_#i(x,y,z) " (where i is the index in the current list)
	- "Point picking" tool:
		* when picking 3 successive points ('triplet' mode), the 3 corresponding angles are displayed
- New tool: 'primitive factory'
	* lets you create custom primitives (plane, box, sphere, cylinder, cone, torus or dish)
	* accessible via the 'Tools > Primitive factory' menu entry or a dedicated icon in the main toolbar
- 'Height grid generation' tool enhanced:

- New display options (display dialog):
	* point marker size (see above)
	* histogram background color
	* label color
- New option for computing normals (CC's way, not qPCL's)

- New icons for CloudCompare and ccViewer
- PCL (Point Cloud Library) 'PCD' files can now be opened without the qPCL plugin
	* only works with ascii and uncompressed binary versions for the moment
- Bug fixes:
	* in the 'Point list picking' tool, when exporting a list of picked points THEN cancelling the picking process, CC will crash
	* SF scale is now rendered by the 'Render to file' tool
	* qPCL's MLS tool would crash if the input cloud has no displayed scalar field! (+ dependency to Luca's PCL patch is now optional)
	* 'shift on load' information is now preserved when sampling points on a mesh (and during several other operations)
	* a group of labels could be freely displaced, eventually leading to a crash (under some circumstances) if the destination is not
		one of the label's associated clouds. On the contrary, labels can now be regrouped and displaced as long as they stay below one
		of their associated clouds.
	* applying an interactive transformation to an entity with an octree could make CC crash (octree was deleted but not removed from DB tree)
	* CC would refuse to open an OBJ file declaring using a material while not defining texture coordinates

v2.4 01/21/2013
- New tool: 'Edit > Mesh > Subdivide' (recursive subdivision)
	* interpolates mesh original colors (if any)
	* only works with single meshes for the moment (not with mesh groups)
	(+ 'Edit > Mesh > Measure surface' now also outputs the mean triangle surface)
- 'Set color' and 'Colorize' can now be applied to groups

v2.4 01/13/2013
- LAZ files support (with laszip - thanks to Ingo Maindorfer)
- STL files support (certainly the ugliest mesh file format ever created, but definitely a largely used one...)
- New tool: export clouds coordinates (X, Y or Z) as scalar fields
	* you'll find it in 'Tools > Projection > Export coordinate(s) to scalar field(s)'
	* very useful to display heights with a color scale or to segment out points depending on their height
- New shortcut: 'Z' to zoom and center camera on selected entities (magnifier icon)
- Toggle shortcuts are now applied RECURSIVELY to any kind of object (even a group for instance)
	(reminder: 'N' for normals, 'C' for colors, 'S' for active scalar field and 'V' for visibility)
- Enhancements:
	* primitives don't loose their attributes (colors, SF, etc.) when cloned
		(they still loose them if display precision is changed however...)
	* CC will only display one global progress bar when loading E57 files with many scans (>10)
- Bug fixes:
	* a space character was missing when exporting a cloud with normals in ASCII format!
	* texture files associated to PLY files should be vertically inverted (at least when the files come from PhotoScan?)
	* e57 scan names were ignored on import
	* OBJ (sub)meshes names were ignored on import
	* a selection composed of parents and (some of their) siblings would produce a corrupted BIN file on export
	* in some cases users could freely segment mesh vertices causing a crash
	* in some cases mesh cloning would fail for no (good) reason
	* when loading primitives from a BIN V2 file, a supplementary (empty) 'vertices' cloud was created
	* mesh groups normals are now correctly handled (they can be safely deleted, exported, etc.)

v2.4 12/16/2012	
- Introducing a new alignment/registration method: "Align (point pairs picking)"
	* aligns clouds by interactively picking 'equivalent' points in both clouds (3 pairs at least)
	* replaces the old "Align (auto)" research tool in the main toolbar (same icon)
	* more information on the wiki: http://www.danielgm.net/cc/doc/wiki/index.php5?title=Alignment_and_Registration
- Perspective mode and lights activation state are now automatically saved and restored (on the creation of a new 3D view or when CC restarts)
- Overlay dialogs (manual segmentation and transformation, point picking, etc.) don't prevent CC from being closed anymore
- 'Height grid generation' tool now gives more choice for the management of empty cells
	+ all types of output (cloud, ASCII grid file, image) behave the same way
- On-screen message display mechanism upgraded
- Meshes without normals are now displayed with the 'diffuse front' material color (this allows one to change the default color of blank meshes)
- New function: "Add constant SF" ("Edit > Scalar Fields" menu)
	* simple way to add new scalar fields (with a constant unique value)
	* very useful in conjunction with "SF Arithmetic" (to add, subtract, multiply or divide another SF by a constant)
- SF Arithmetic ("Edit > Scalar Fields > Arithmetic") has a new icon (a calculator, instead of the 'diff' text with a colorbar)
- PLY files associated with a texture file (comment with 'TextureFile' keyword - generated by PhotoScan for instance) are now supported
- LAS import filter improved:
	* 'time' and 'return number' fields are now supported (i.e. imported as scalar fields)
	* color coding (8 bits or 16 bits) is automatically detected (see associated bug below)
	* importer is more clever (fields with a unique value are automatically ignored - in case you really need them, they can be created 
		afterwards with the "Add constant SF" method - see above)
- ASCII export filter:
	* adaptive precision when writing point coordinates (typically if the cloud has been shifted at loading time due to too large coordinates)
	* if the file extension is 'PTS', color components will be written after the scalar field value(s) so as to be readable by Autocad
- Bug fixes:
	* color from LAS point clouds were badly imported/exported (treated as 8 bits integers instead of 16 bits!).
	* 'Height grid generation' tool was generating badly shaped scalar fields that wouldn't be correctly saved in BIN files (corrupted files)
	* the plane primitive generated by the 'plane orientation' tool was not automatically added to DB tree
	* per-triangle normals are removed with 'Edit > Normals > Clear'
	* the mesh sampling method was not sampling normals in specific cases
	* custom light materials were wrongly set (in practical, custom light wasn't working at all!)
	* a bug in the display mechanism of meshes with textures (coordinates) could make CC crash... randomly
	* segmenting a cloud with labels would make CC crash (for the moment labels are simply removed... we need to be more clever!)
	* OS X portage --> lots of associated bugs... almost all solved ;)

v2.4 11/06/2012
- Bug fixes:
	* plane orientation tool was always returning a wrong plane normal ( N(0,0,1) by default )
	* segmenting a primitive or an entity with associated primitives would make CC crash
		(primitive segmentation is disabled for the moment!)

v2.4 10/31/2012
- New primitive objects: cone, torus, dish, box, snout and profile extrusion
- New format handled (and the first 'CAD' one): Aveva PDMS '.mac' scripts
	(support for all above primitives + already existing ones: cylinder, planes and spheres)
- Height grid generation (=rasterization) upgraded:
	* source cloud's scalar field(s) can now be projected as well (+ various opions to interpolate the SF values in each cell)
	* main projection dimension can be set (X, Y or Z)
- Points sampling on a mesh upgraded:
	* source mesh per-triangle or per-vertices normals are now taken into account
	* user can choose to interpolate colors and/or textures
- New filters available in qPCL plugin (thanks to Luca):
	* remove outliers using statistical approach (SIFT keypoints)
	* smooth (and optionally upsample) a point cloud using MLS estimators
- New button added in the graphical segmentation tool: "confirm and delete hidden points".
	It's a shortcut: hidden points are automatically be deleted and the original cloud is not split in two.
- New entries in the DB tree context menu: "Expand branch" and "Collapse branch" (to fully expand/collapse a branch)
- Bug fixes:
	* the normal index for each face vertex was missing when saving a mesh with per-vertex normals to an OBJ file.
	(this would typically make Meshlab crash ;). Just open them with this new version of CC and overwrite them to fix them.
	* potential crash when using the research option 'enable furthest points removal' during registration (ICP)
- PLY files saved by CloudCompare have (once again) field names "compatible" with MeshLab.
	The 'vertex_indices' field has changed to 'vertex_indexes' in the last versions of CC ... and this make Meshlab crash...
	(I've already ranted about that before: the PLY format doesn't impose any particular field name and it's the responsibility
	of the loader to handle that... Paraview do this wonderfully for instance ;)

v2.4 09/22/2012
- Cloud-cloud distance computation with local models enhanced/fixed: the user can now choose either a number of neighbors or a sphere
	radius that will be used to compute local models. One can also choose to compute a model for every points or, as an approximation,
	to "share" local models between neighbors (faster... but noisier - in fact this was done by default before!).
- New tools accessible in command line mode: density, roughness, curvature and SF gradient.
	(see wiki: http://www.danielgm.net/cc/doc/wiki/index.php5?title=CommandLine)
- When exporting a cloud to a LAS file, any scalar field named 'LAS classification' will now be handled as a proper LAS classification
	field.
- PCV plugin (ShadeVis-like global illumination algorithm) can now take a point cloud with normals as input. The normals will be used
	as lighting directions (instead of the default directions randomly sampled on a hemisphere or a sphere). Note that only the normals
	are taken into account as the lighting direction is simulated in orthographic mode (no perspective, i.e. the relative position of
	the light source has no effect on the result).

v2.4 07/28/2012
- Shift applied to clouds with too large coordinates can now be applied to all opened files (in case of multiple selection):
	* "Apply all" button added to dialog
	* shift information is stored in BIN files and is now 'reverted' with ASCII, OBJ, MA, VTK, PLY, LAS & E57 formats (i.e. ASCII or 64 bits formats)
- New menu entry "Display > Active scalar field" (this menu is active if a unique cloud or mesh is selected):
	* Toggle color scale: show or hide color scale (shortcut: SHIFT+C)
	* Show previous SF: show previous scalar field (shortcut: SHIFT + up arrow)
	* Show next SF: show next scalar field (shortcut: SHIFT + down arrow)
- First (skipped) line of ASCII files can now be used to read out 'headers' for columns
	* a new checkbox is available at the bottom of the ASCII import wizard.
	* the header line must have as much blocks as columns in the file (so be sure not to use space characters in names if the file delimiter is also the space character!)
	* for the moment, only the scalar fields names are used by the ASCII importer 
- Bugs fixed:
	* 2D Viewport objects can now be dragged and dropped, and can be loaded properly from BIN files
	* centered perspective mode could behave strangely when zooming in close to objects with large coordinates
	* render to file based on FBO (frame buffer object) with a zoom different than 1 was done without depth component!
	* distance computation timing displayed in Console was in microseconds instead of seconds!

v2.4 07/18/2012
- qRansac_SD plugin is back! (Ransac Shape Detection by Schnabel et. al)
- Bilateral gaussian filter for scalar fields added (Thanks Luca)
- Ranges computation from a sensor added (Thanks Luca)
- Scattering angles computation from a sensor added (Thanks Luca)
- Loaded mesh vertices that are not shared by multiple sub-meshes are not 'locked' by default anymore
- No more system console on Windows
- Bugs fixed:
	* under certain circumstances, when two clouds with different scalar fields were fused, 
		random values would be set to the points that hadn't any before (instead of NaN).
	* a bug with the internal timer was preventing CC from properly updating mesh bounding-boxes
		(after a transformation typically) or the messages in 3D views from disappearing
	* PLY files with comment lines before the format line (in header) would be rejected by
		the new version of RPLY (RPLY has been patched to accept this again).

v2.4 07/03/2012
- LAS file import now handles intensity and classification fields
- The 2D part of labels is no longer displayed in 2D in the 'Point list picking' tool (to mimic the old version)
- New type of label: rectangular area labels can be defined on screen to annotate a particular zone
	(they can be created with the Point Picking tool - don't forget to "save" the label once created)
- Test in progress: weighted ICP with associated scalar field(s) values
- Bugs fixed:
	* some algorithms applied on multiple entities at the same time could make CC crash
	* E57 reading crashed since last version!

v2.4 06/27/2012
- 64 bits version is now compiled with Visual 2010 (should avoid issues with the Visual 2008 redistributable pack on Seven & Vista)
- normals are now supported with E57 format
- shortcut added: 'Pick rotation center' icon added to the left 'view' tool bar (let the user pick a point to be used as rotation center for its hosting 3D view)
- bugs fixed:
	* point list picking now displays proper labels in the 3D view (+ all points are stored in a separate group)
	* Bundler '.out' file containing keypoints without associated color are now correctly handled
	* Bundler v0.4 files are now correctly handled

v2.4 06/24/2012
- CloudCompare 64 bits version available (Windows & Linux) 
- Introducing BIN "V2" format (highly enhanced):
	* almost any type of entity and their display option can be saved (all selected elements with their siblings)
	* this format can freely evolve while keeping backward compatibility (integrated version management)
	* loading time is much faster
	* 32/64 bits compatible
- Point picking now spawns labels
	* labels can simply be created anytime by holding the SHIFT key and clicking on a 3D point
	* labels are independent objects that can be moved on screen, hidden, saved (BIN V2), etc.
	* labels can be collapsed with a right click
	* point list picking and point/segment/triplet picking dialogs have been updated accordingly
- ccViewer upgraded:
	* ccViewer also supports labels (loading and creating with SHIFT+click)
	* selected entities can now be deleted with the DEL key (or Menu > Options > Selected entity > Delete)
- New format supported: E57 point clouds (ASTM E2807 standard) thanks to libE57 (http://www.libe57.org)
- New plugin: 'qPCL' a wrapper to the PCL library (http://pointclouds.org).
	For the moment, it only allows for loading and saving PCD files and computing normals on a point cloud.
	But many filters will follow! (thanks to Luca Penasa)
- New method: conversion from cloud normals to HSV colors (Edit > Normals > Convert to HSV)
- Scalar fields boundaries can now be set by user (check the 'release boundaries' checkbox in the scalar field properties and manually set the desired values in the min and max 'displayed' values spinboxes)
- Distance computation tool can now split the result along each dimension (X,Y and Z) in the case of cloud-cloud distance
	(very useful to get only the vertical displacement for instance)
- DB tree elements now have a context menu (right click) to enable/disable standard features (visibility, color, normals, scalar field) or delete the selected element(s), etc.
- Entities in the DB tree can now be moved manually (with drag & drop) or sorted alphabetically (via the context menu)
- New (empty) groups can be added in the DB tree (via the context menu)
- Graphical segmentation tool has been enhanced (rectangular selection with CTRL key + right mouse button pressed, constant feedback, etc.)
- Display properties dialog has been reorganized
- Histogram labels are now using the color scale 'precision' parameter value (see Display > Display Settings)
- Image ortho-rectification enhanced (Bundler import filter):
  * bug fix: the previous version was generating ortho-rectified images with a non constant pixel scale!
  * a 'ortho_rectification_log.txt' file is now generated along the images with relative position for each (in pixels, relatively to the first image)
  * images are now processed sequentially, and the user can choose whether they should be kept in memory or not
  * ortho-rectification as images (on disk) is now available through command line arguments (see wiki: http://www.danielgm.net/cc/doc/wiki/index.php5?title=CommandLine)
- Multiple clouds can now be automatically saved in multiple ASCII files
	* select several clouds then 'Save' them as ASCII files
	* enter a base name with an extension (hint: any occurrence of the string 'cloudname' will be replaced by each cloud name)
	* CC will generate one file per cloud, with an automatic suffix ('basename_000001.asc', etc.)

v2.4 04/24/2012
- Bug fix: crash when displaying the histogram after computing statistical parameters
- Bug fix: once loaded, a VTK mesh couldn't be manually transformed and its vertices didn't appear in the DB tree
- Bug fix: when computing distances between two clouds with a 'maximum distance' threshold fixed, this maximum distance value was assigned to points with zero distance!
- Bug fix: when saving PLY files with scalar fields having spaces characters in their name, reloading was not possible (hack: even for binary PLY files, the header is in ASCII mode and can manually be edited --> replace all spaces in the SF name by underscores)
- Bug fix: when checking/unchecking an item in the DB tree, its properties were displayed even if the item was not selected
- Snavely's Bundler file import tool can now generate 2D orthorectified images (directly saved alongside original images)

v2.4 01/04/2012
- Simple Laplacian smoothing algorithm for mesh added (see Edit > Mesh > Smooth (Laplacian))
- VTK cloud/mesh filter added (import & export - early version!)

- qPoissonRecon now uses PoissonRecon V3 (http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/PoissonRecon). Works also on Linux now.
- PLY files saved by CloudCompare now use 'properties' names compatible with MeshLab (to cope with the lack of flexibility of this - however great - tool ;)
- All scalar fields associated to a cloud are now saved in PLY files (with their name as property name + prefix 'SCALAR_')
- Bug in Delaunay 2D triangulation on least square best fitting plane fixed.
- Crash during OBJ files loading fixed (the crash occurred when the file was referring to materials but no material file was declared)
- The Windows release has been compiled with Visual Studio 2008. You may have to install Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86) to launch CloudCompare.
- Project can/should now be compiled with CMake (www.cmake.org). See http://www.danielgm.net/cc/doc/wiki/index.php5?title=Compilation_CMake

v2.3 02/14/2012
- Noah Snavely's Bundler import filter is now able to use an alternative cloud (or mesh) as keypoints source.
	If it's a mesh, it can also be used as DTM for generating colored pseudo-DTM vertices
- Transformation matrix is now properly output in console (either after registration process, or after interactive editing).
	This transformation can be copied & pasted in the new 'Edit > Apply transformation' dialog that replaces 'Edit > Translate'.
- A bug in connected components extraction with octree has been fixed (in rare cases, the process could make CC crash)

v2.3 01/28/2012
- Height function (quadric) fitting fixed and enhanced
- Noah Snavely's Bundler import filter is now able to ortho-recitfy images, undistort them and generate a colored pseudo-DTM
- (calibrated) images can now be saved as standard images
- Distance computation between a point cloud and a mesh has been optimized (new multi-threaded version + the old version is slightly faster & needs less memory)
- Bug in scalar field arithmetic fixed (difference between two positive scalar field is not necessarily positive!)
- the 'Render to file' tool with a zoom factor (different from 1) now works properly when based on FBO

v2.3 01/18/2012
- Noah Snavely's Bundler output file (with 'out' extension - see http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/) can now be opened in CloudCompare.
  CloudCompare will extract the point cloud as well as calibrated cameras information and will then try to load associated pictures.
- This version should fix an issue with distance computation on Windows 7 (crash)

v2.3 01/07/2012
- new shortcuts added (see wiki)
- points and faces count in properties view are now displayed with thousands separator
- 'plane orientation' tool now creates semi transparent planes (polygon stippling in fact)

- EDL filter has been slightly updated (isolated points appear no more black)

v2.3 12/13/2011
- scalar fields loading bug fixed
- color ramp type and number of steps are now per-scalar field and not per-cloud

v2.3 12/11/2011

v2.3 11/22/2011
- A bug in CCLib (ReferenceCloud) has been corrected. It may have impacted ICP registration for clouds below 20000 points.
- the code has been cleaned-up with 'cppcheck' (http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/ - great tool!)
- the multi-core octree-based computations mechanism is back! (seems that it has mistakenly been disabled a while ago... hum hum)
- ASCII file loading changed: from now on, only one cloud can be loaded at a time, but the fields order doesn't matter any more
(a scalar field can be set before points coordinates, etc.) and loading is also slightly faster.
- if available, FBO (Frame Buffer Object) is systematically used to store the last displayed 3D scene. This allows very fast redraw
of the 3D view when viewpoint and cloud properties are not changed (i.e. during interactive graphical segmentation, or anytime the
application window needs to be redrawn when requested by the OS or Qt - when a menu overlaps the 3D view, or the window is moved, etc.).

v2.3 10/16/2011
- Point cloud fusion tool improved (much less buggy!)
