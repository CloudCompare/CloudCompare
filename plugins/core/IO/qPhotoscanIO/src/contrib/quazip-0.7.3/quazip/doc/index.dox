 * \section overview Overview
 * 
 * QuaZIP is a simple C++ wrapper over <a
 * href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html">Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP
 * package</a> that can be used to access ZIP archives. It uses <a
 * href="http://qt.digia.com/">the Qt toolkit</a>.
 *
 * If you do not know what Qt is, you have two options:
 * - Just forget about QuaZIP.
 * - Learn more about Qt by downloading it and/or reading the excellent <a
 *   href="http://qt-project.org/doc/">official Qt documentation</a>
 *
 * The choice is yours, but if you are really interested in
 * cross-platform (Windows/Linux/BSD/UNIX/Mac/Others) software
 * development, I would definitely recommend you the latter ^_^
 *
 * QuaZIP allows you to access files inside ZIP archives using QIODevice
 * API, and - yes! - that means that you can also use QTextStream,
 * QDataStream or whatever you would like to use on your zipped files.
 *
 * QuaZIP provides complete abstraction of the ZIP/UNZIP API, for both
 * reading from and writing to ZIP archives.
 *
 * \section download Download QuaZIP
 *
 * Downloads are available from <a
 * href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/">QuaZIP project's page
 * at SourceForge.net</a>.
 *
 * \section platforms Platforms supported
 *
 * QuaZIP has been currently tested on the following platforms:
 * - linux-g++ (Ubuntu 11.10, Qt 4.7.4)
 * - freebsd-g++ (Qt 4.0.0
 * - hpux-acc (HP-UX 11.11)
 * - hpux-g++ (HP-UX 11.11)
 * - win32-g++ (MinGW)
 * - win32-msvc2010 (MS VS 2010 Express, Qt 4.8.4)
 * - win32-msvc2010 (Qt Creator, Qt 5.0.1)
 * - win32-msvc2012 (Qt Creator, Qt 5.2.0)
 * - some Symbian version, reportedly
 * 
 * No testing has been officially done on other systems. Of course, patches to
 * make it work on any platform that it currently does not work on are
 * always welcome!
 *
 * \section whats-new What is new in this version of QuaZIP?
 *
 * See the NEWS.txt file supplied with the distribution.
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * Just <a href="http://www.zlib.org/">zlib</a> and Qt 4/5. Well, Qt 4
 * depends on zlib anyway, but you will need zlib headers to compile
 * QuaZIP. With Qt5 sometimes you need the zlib library as well (on
 * Windows, for example).
 *
 * \section building Building, testing and installing
 *
 * \note Instructions given in this section assume that you are
 * using some UNIX dialect, but the build process should be very similar
 * on win32-g++ platform too. On other platforms it's essentially the
 * same process, maybe with some qmake adjustments not specific to
 * QuaZIP itself.
 *
 * To build the library, run:
\verbatim
$ cd /wherever/quazip/source/is/quazip-x.y.z/quazip
$ qmake [PREFIX=where-to-install]
$ make
\endverbatim
 *
 * Make sure that you have Qt 4/5 installed with all required headers and
 * utilities (that is, including the 'dev' or 'devel' package on Linux)
 * and that you run qmake utility of the Qt 4, not some other version
 * you may have already installed (you may need to type full path to
 * qmake like /usr/local/qt4/bin/qmake).
 *
 * To reconfigure (with another PREFIX, for example), just run qmake
 * with appropriate arguments again.
 *
 * If you need to specify additional include path or libraries, use
 * qmake features (see qmake reference in the Qt documentation). For
 * example:
 *
\verbatim
$ qmake LIBS+=-L/usr/local/zlib/lib INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/local/zlib/include
\endverbatim
 * (note abscence of "-I" before the include path and the presence of "-L"
 * before the lib path)
 *
 * Also note that you may or may not need to define ZLIB_WINAPI (qmake
 * DEFINES+=ZLIB_WINAPI) when linking to zlib on Windows, depending on
 * how zlib was built (generally, if using zlibwapi.dll, this define is
 * needed).
 *
 * To install compiled library:
\verbatim
$ make install
\endverbatim
 *
 * By default, QuaZIP compiles as a DLL/SO, but you have other
 * options:
 * - Just copy appropriate source files to your project and use them,
 * but you need to define QUAZIP_STATIC before including any QuaZIP
 * headers (best done as a compiler option). This will save you from
 * possible side effects of importing/exporting QuaZIP symbols.
 * - Compile it as a static library using CONFIG += staticlib qmake
 * option. QUAZIP_STATIC is defined automatically by qmake in this case.
 *
 * Binary compatibility is guaranteed between minor releases starting
 * with version 0.5, thanks to the Pimpl idiom. That is, the next binary
 * incompatible version will be 1.x.
 *
 * \section test Testing
 *
 * To check if QuaZIP's basic features work OK on your platform, you may
 * wish to compile the test suite provided in test directory:
\verbatim
$ cd /wherever/quazip/source/is/quazip-x.y.z/qztest
$ qmake
$ make
$ ./qztest
\endverbatim
 *
 * Note that the test suite looks for the quazip library in the "quazip"
 * folder of the project ("../quazip"), but you may wish to use LIBS
 * for some systems (Windows often puts the library in the separate
 * "debug" or "release" directory). If you wish to use the quazip
 * version that's already installed, provide the appropriate path.
 *
 * On some systems you may need to set PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
 * SHLIB_PATH to get "qztest" to actually run.
 *
 * If everything went fine, the test suite should report a lot of PASS
 * messages. If something goes wrong, it will provide details and a
 * warning that some tests failed.
 *
 * \section using Using
 *
 * See \ref usage "usage page".
 * 
 * \section contacts Authors and contacts
 *
 * This wrapper has been written by Sergey A. Tachenov, AKA Alqualos.
 * This is my first open source project, so it may suck, but I did not
 * find anything like that, so I just had no other choice but to write
 * it.
 *
 * If you have anything to say to me about QuaZIP library, feel free to
 * do so (read the \ref faq first, though). I can not promise,
 * though, that I fix all the bugs you report in, add any features you
 * want, or respond to your critics, or respond to your feedback at all.
 * I may be busy, I may be tired of working on QuaZIP, I may be even
 * dead already (you never know...).
 *
 * To report bugs or to post ideas about what should be done, use
 * SourceForge.net's <a
 * href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=142688">trackers</a>.
 * If you want to send me a private message, use my e-mail address
 * stachenov@gmail.com.
 *
 * Do not use e-mail to report bugs, please. Reporting bugs and problems
 * with the SourceForge.net's bug report system has that advantage that
 * it is visible to public, and I can always search for open tickets
 * that were created long ago. It is highly unlikely that I will search
 * my mail for that kind of stuff, so if a bug reported by mail isn't
 * fixed immediately, it will likely be forgotten forever.
